### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm David, a full-stack software developer from Bristol

<div style='display:flex, flex-direction:column, justify-content:center'>

<div style='display:flex'>
A bit about me: I'm a languages graduate with a professional background in Money Advice at Citizens Advice and as a self-taught music producer. I've always loved learning new skills and technologies which led to be enrolling in the School of Code bootcamp in 2024! 
<br/><br/>
I have just started my first role as an Apprentice Developer at Motability Operations.
<br/><br/>
 âš¡ Fun fact: In addition to coding languages, I love learning spoken languages too - I studied French and Italian at University and am currently learning Welsh.
<br/><br/>
If you want to chat about cool projects or anything else, get in touch!
