### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm David, a full-stack software developer from Bristol.

A bit about me: I'm a languages graduate with a professional background as an adviser at Citizens Advice and as a self-taught music producer. I've always loved learning new skills and technologies and completed the School of Code bootcamp in 2024! I'm now looking for my first role in tech!

 ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on a number of projects to add to my portfolio. Initially, I intend to go over the content of the bootcamp and create a weather app, use the Spotify for Devs tools to create something cool and try out Threejs - as I love Blender and would love to incoporate some 3d in my learning.

âš¡ Fun fact: In addition to coding languages, I love learning spoken languages too - I studied French and Italian at University and am currently learning Welsh.
